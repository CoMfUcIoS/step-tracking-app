## TODO List
- ~~Record user's Charity Name, Fundraising Link, Region and Total Donation amount~~
- Ability to show regional leaderboards
- ~~New leaderboard, ranked by donation amount~~
- Logo's / copy changes
- ~~Change title and page header to Mental Health May.~~ I'll ping you the logos through
- ~~Live reload of dashboards~~
- ~~summary of all steps of the region and the sum of money at the top of the page (next to the title)~~
- ~~what about putting an exchange rate field under the region - which defaults to the biggest office there and can be changed by user? Thinking about ways to get the money right...~~
